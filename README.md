## Overview
Crosshair X is a powerful tool designed for gamers, offering extensive customization options for in-game crosshairs, especially in shooter games. If you've ever wondered how to create the perfect crosshair for games like Rust or CS:GO, Crosshair X is the solution. It provides a variety of preset options, as well as the ability to design a completely custom crosshair from scratch using an intuitive editor.

Users can adjust the color, size, thickness, and placement of the crosshair, tailoring it to their personal preferences. Additionally, the software allows you to define specific reactions for the lines based on different in-game conditions.

This tool significantly improves aiming accuracy in games like CS:GO, Fortnite, and survival titles like Rust, where a central marker might be missing. It even integrates with Xbox and Game Bar, making it easy to select your preferred crosshair style. In the "Lines" section, you can modify the width and positioning of the crosshair lines, which can be made transparent or bright for better visibility. In the "Center Dot" section, you can adjust the properties of the central dot, including its color and size, to suit your exact preferences.

## User Experience
Crosshair X is extremely user-friendly, utilizing sliders to fine-tune every aspect of your crosshair overlay. You can also share your custom designs with friends or upload any image to use as a crosshair, adding a personal touch and a social aspect to your gaming experience. The tool offers additional features such as switching sight visibility, managing multiple saved presets for different games, and exporting your custom crosshairs in PNG or SVG formats.

What sets Crosshair X apart from other similar tools is its depth of customization. You can adjust everything, from line opacity and length to rotation, and tweak the center point, outlines, and other elements. One unique feature is the Bloom effect, which causes the crosshair to expand when you shoot, adding a layer of realism to your gameplay.


## Limitations
Despite its many advantages, no tool is without drawbacks. A key issue to note is that when playing certain games in full-screen mode, the crosshair may freeze or fail to appear entirely. However, you can still use it in windowed mode, though some input lag may be experienced in this setup.
